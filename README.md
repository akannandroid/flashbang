flashbang
=========

flashbang is my very first (other than a 'Hello World') Android app in my quest to familiarize myself with mobile development.

It poorly emulates a flashbang by playing an explosion noise, changing the screen color, and flashing the camera flash when the phone is whipped/jerked/thrown/shaken sufficiently fast.

I use the Camera API as well as the Sensor API to achieve this.

I was fortunate to come across this great [tutorial on the accelerometer](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/a-quick-tutorial-on-coding-androids-accelerometer/) which I used as a framework for that functionality.

Have fun with it!
